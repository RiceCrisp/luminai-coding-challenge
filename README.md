# Luminai Coding Challenge

This is a coding challenge that I was asked to complete by Luminai, and then they didn't even look at it or reply to me! Weeee!

I used [Chrome Extension Boilerplate](https://github.com/lxieyang/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react) so those install steps should all be the same

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
3. Access [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
4. Check "Developer mode"
5. Select the `build` folder
